#Introduction:
This workshop, in the style of [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.
We will cover Data organization in spreadsheets, Introduction to R, Data analysis and visualization in R. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.

## Requirements:
Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed below, please install latest version for maximum compatibility).

- [R](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop) (the open source 'free' version) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

## Objectives:
- Initiate and provide training to participants in organized reproducible data workflow
- Produce a structured data management and archiving plan for individual projects


## Instructors:
- David Beauchesne
- Rémi Daigle
- Angela Grant
